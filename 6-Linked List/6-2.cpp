/** HOW?
 * let's say 2 people are running in a circular track, one person is running slowly and another person is running faster(2 times the speed of first person)

 * After a certain period of time person 2 again meet or overtake person 1,

 * In that case we can conclude that the track is circular ( replace running track with our Linked list)
